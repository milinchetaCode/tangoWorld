## For Event Organizers

### Adding Location Coordinates to Events
When creating a new event, you can now add optional latitude and longitude coordinates to enable your event to appear on the map view.

**How to add coordinates:**
1. Go to the event creation form
2. In the **Location** section, after filling in the City and Venue fields, you'll see:
   - **Latitude (optional)** field
   - **Longitude (optional)** field
3. Enter the coordinates for your event location
   - Example: Paris coordinates are Latitude: 48.8566, Longitude: 2.3522
4. Submit your event

**Finding coordinates:**
- Use Google Maps: Right-click on your venue location and select the coordinates shown at the top
- Use online geocoding services to convert an address to coordinates
- Coordinates are optional, but highly recommended for better event visibility

**Tips:**
- Accurate coordinates help attendees find your event more easily
- Events with coordinates get better visibility on the map view
- Double-check coordinates before submitting to ensure accuracy
